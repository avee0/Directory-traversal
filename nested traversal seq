To solve the lab, retrieve the contents of the /etc/passwd file. 


    Use Burp Suite to intercept and modify a request that fetches a product image. 
    Modify the filename parameter,
    giving it the value: ....//....//....//etc/passwd Observe that the response contains the contents of the /etc/passwd file. 
    
    proccess is same us previous but here they are striping our traversal payload to bypass it use 
    
    ....//....//....//etc/passwd
    ....//....//....//etc//passwd
    
    
    
You might be able to use nested traversal sequences, such as ....// or ....\/, which will revert to simple traversal sequences when the inner sequence is stripped.
