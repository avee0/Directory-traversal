 If an application requires that the user-supplied filename must start with the expected base folder, such as /var/www/images, then it might be possible to include the required base folder followed by suitable traversal sequences. For example:

filename=/var/www/images/../../../etc/passwd 

use payload = ../../../etc/passwd

for just testing perpose you can also use encoded value of ../
