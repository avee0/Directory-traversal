#intro 

directory traversal is a attack that can perform by malicious user to read server file or document.
direcroty traversal attack can give attacker to access of sensitive files and crendintials for back end server. 
attacker might be write the files.attacker can take full control of server by this vulnerability 

lets assume that you visited a shopping website:
shopping website load image from server. 
image located in server (var/html/photo.png)


when browser load a image it can send a request to server thats something look like this:

> htttp://website.in/image?filename=photo.png

paramter can be modified by attacker to perform directory traversa. 
linux normal payload = /../../etc/passwd 
winddow normal payload = \..\..\windows\win.ini #  On Windows, both ../ and ..\ are valid directory traversal sequences, and an equivalent attack to retrieve a standard operating system file would be:



 thank you :)
